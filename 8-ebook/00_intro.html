    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>
        We think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We believe we are making it in our own image... But the
        computer is not really like us. It is a projection of a very slim part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic,
        order, rule, and clarity.
